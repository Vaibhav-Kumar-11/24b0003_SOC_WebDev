        <h3>Hi, I am Vaibhav</h3>

        <p>A student in <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" target="_main">IIT Bombay</a>, pursuing my B.Tech degree in <b>Aerospace Engineering.</b></p>

        <div><p>I’m currently entering my second year of college, having gained a diverse range of experiences throughout my first year—from academic learnings to active involvement in various clubs and team projects. Building on that foundation, I’m now diving deeper into the technical side of things. I’ve recently started exploring HTML, Web Development, and Artificial Intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), and I’m eager to strengthen my coding skills and problem-solving mindset. This phase is all about expanding my horizons, contributing to impactful projects, and aligning my interests with future-ready technologies.
